-i have created an easy to use app that helps the user Hera choose a meal based on the time of day. 

-i kept the ui as clean as possible kepping in mind

How to use meal genie

-step 1:first think is once she opens up the app, she will be shown a screen that would allow her to input the time of day. 

-step 2:  Hera will type morning and press the suggest button, which the app will then suggest she eats an omlette. 

-step 4: once she is done she can press reset.

-The app is very clear and will not be difficult to use
