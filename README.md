# imad-task.1
i have created an easy to use app that helps the user Hera choose a meal based on the time of day. first think is once she opens up the app, she will be shown a screen that would allow her to input the time of day. Hera will type morning and press the suggest button which the app will then suggest she eats an omlette. once she is done she can press reset.
The app is very clear and is not confusing to use
